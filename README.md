# Evolution Dynamics Engine : Cheni Makes :/
A dynamic, grid-based ecosystem simulation featuring autonomous creatures, food generation, evolution behavior, and real-time visualization. Built using Python and Matplotlib, designed for experimentation, optimization, and long-term ecosystem modeling.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧬 **Autonomous Creatures** with wander, seek, and eat behaviors  
- 🌱 **Food Generation System** with adjustable growth rate & max limits  
- 🧠 **Evolution Parameters** (speed, perception, efficiency, etc.)  
- 🎨 **Smooth Real-Time Visualization** using Matplotlib animation  
- 🛠️ **Configurable Settings** for grid size, population, and food mechanics  
- 🐾 **Trail Rendering** with fade-out to reduce clutter  
- 🧹 **Anti-Glitch Movement** (no jittering, no flying across map)
